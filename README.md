#Summary:
	Our project will be an implementation of the standard game of checkers with various AI difficulties that can 
	
	be played against. The difficulties will be normal, hard, and impossible.  Our intention is to program the
	
	normal difficulty to play like someone with	moderate knowledge of how to play the game beyond the rules.  The 
	
	hard difficulty would employ more in-depth AI that will play the game like a seasoned player.  Impossible will 
	
	be our attempt at creating an AI that will always beat a human player or tie in the event of a “perfect game.” 
	
	This last mode will likely be a reach goal as it was only accomplished in 2007 by Jonathan Schaeffer at	the 
	
	University of Alberta.  Might be difficult to implement in Racket but it seems like an interesting goal if the 
	
	algorithms are	public.  We have been to their website but lots of the pages surrounding their paper on the 
	
	solution are down.

#Division of work

1 – Front end:
One of us does the front end and works on implementing a 2 player mode. This person will also look into implementing a server (maybe use UMass Lowell's) to coordinate between front and back end. This includes hosting the game on a server, and getting moves from both player using TCP or HTTP.

2 – AI:
One of us creates a simple AI (maybe multiple difficulties if one proves too simple) to the best of our ability.

3 – Advanced AI:
We were inspired to do this when we discovered someone implemented a perfect AI that can’t be beaten. The goal here would be to utilize a complex higher algorithm to emulate an AI such as the perfect one. By doing this we hope to enhance our problem-solving approach by conducting research and making a solution that we wouldn’t normally create on our own.
